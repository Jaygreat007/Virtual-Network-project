# Virtual-Network-project

<h2>Description</h2>
A Virtual Network Project involves the design, deployment, and management of a network infrastructure in a virtualized environment. The goal is to create a flexible, scalable, and efficient network infrastructure that mimics physical networks but is entirely software-defined. 
<br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Cisco packet</b> 

-<b>Mac ios</b>  

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
This is just a warning for the viewers. This is not a step-by-step on how to build a Virtual Network. These screenshots are to add more in-depth to the project and to show viewers my progress.

<br />
<br />Confirms that computer number two can ping from computer number one. This shows that everything is working and that the computers can successfully communicate and that I was successful in setting up the computer's IP address:  <br/>

<br />This screenshot shows that printer two can ping from computer one.Which demonstrates that everything was successfully set up and that the two technologies can communicate with each other successfully::  <br/>
